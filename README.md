#Digital Deployment Website Migration Tool

This Website Migration Tool is used by Digital Deployment in conjunction with Digital Deployments Drupal Import Module.
The tool uses Java and **JSOUP**, a Java library for parsing HTML, to crawl websites for content and exports them in
JSON format to `.json` files.
